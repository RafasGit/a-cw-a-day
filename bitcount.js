// We describe the problem our solution is to solve; we are to create a solution that takes in an integer input and returns number of bits equal to one in binary representation of the number
// we explain our parameters and the inputs they will take in
// We then give what we expect to be our return value.
// We then give our examples to be used as test cases
// We give our pseudocode explaining non-technically our solution
// We give our solution code
// We then test out out examples
