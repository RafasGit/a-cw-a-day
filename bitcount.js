// We describe the problem our solution is to solve; we are to create a solution that takes in an integer input and returns number of bits equal to one in binary representation of the number
// we explain our parameters and the inputs they will take in; we define a parameter that takes in a number 
// We then give what we expect to be our return value; we return our count of binary representations that equals one 
// We then give our examples to be used as test cases; countBits(0) // --> 0; countBits(4) // --> 1; countBits(10) // --> 2;
// We give our pseudocode explaining non-technically our solution; we convert each number input into string to get its binary representation, loop through and if its binary representation is equal to one, we add to our variable count. 
// We give our solution code
// We then test out out examples
