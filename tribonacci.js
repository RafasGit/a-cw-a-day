// We will describe the problem we are to solve; 
// We then describe the parameters we will define
// We then give our return statement 
// We give our examples to be used as tests
// We give our pseudocode solution; we first take in the array of values and the required length of the triboonacci sequence, we then check if the required sequence is 0, in which case we return 0
// We give our solution code 
// We test out our examples
