// We are to create a function that tells our cyclist the number of litres they need to drink for given number of hours given that he consumes 0.5 litres per hour
// We create the parameter 'time' which will take in the number of hours our cyclist will be actively cycling in integer format, no strings will be passed and empty arguments .
// We are going to return the total number of litres our cyclist will need rounded to the smallest value
// A few test cases include; time = 3; --> 1.5, time = 2.2; --> 1, time = 0; --> 0
