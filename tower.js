// We are going to define our problem to solve; we are to create a tower out of '*' strings with the tower increasing in size every column 
// We will then define the parameters we are to declare
// We then give the return value that we are to expect
// We will then give our examples to be used as test cases; eg1; eg2; eg3;
// We then give our pseudocode explaining how we will solve the issue using non-technical terms
// We give our solution code
// We then test our examples
