// We input a sentence and if the length of the words is greater than 5 strings, we return the reversed version of the word

//The parameters we input into our function are sentences made up of strings and we do not expect either integers or empty parameters
//We are going to return the input sentences with  their words that have more than five characters reversed and words with less than 5 characters as they were
// We split the sentence into individual array elements, we loop through the array and for elements of length greater/equal to 5 are  split, reversed then joined and store it in a new variable
// We then return the new variable
