// We accept two inputs, one for the number of students and one for the number of pages per student required and calculate the total pages used
// We set two parameters, one for number of students and second one for pages per student. If either parameter is set to value of zero, we return 0
// We return the value of number of total copies required and if no copies required, we return 0
//  Our testcases include; n = 6, m = 4 : 24, n = 7, m = 0 : 0, n = 5, m = 3 : 15
