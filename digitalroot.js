// We are to provide our problem to solve; we are to find the recursive sum of all digits in a number
// We provide our parameters to accept inputs
// We then define our return statement
// We provide our examples to be used as test cases
// We give our solution in form of non-technical jargon
// We then give our solution code
// We test out our example test cases
