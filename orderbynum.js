// We are to sort a given string in ascending order with each number in each word the determining factor for sorting
//We describe the parameters that we will define; we will define a parameter that will take in the input string

//We declare our expected return values; we are to return the input string having been sorted with the word with the smallest integer leading
// We also give our examples/ test cases
// We will then give our pseudocode to walkthrough our solution
// We then give our solution code written in js
// We then give our example test cases;
 
// 1st test case;
// 2nd test case;
// 3rd test case;
