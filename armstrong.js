// We will define the problem we are to solve; we are to intake an integer and determine if  it is narcissistic, i.e; the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself
// We will then declare our parameters
// We then declare our return statement
// We give our example cases; eg1; eg2; eg3;
// We then give our non-technical explanation to the solution 
// we give our code solution 
// We test out our examples
