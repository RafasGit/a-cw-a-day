// We will define the problem to be solved; we are to accept a string and return it having been split into pairs of characters and for odd numbered characters, return ('_') with the final pair
//We will then define our parameters; we will define a parameter that accepts our string to split 
  
// We then declare our return value
// We then give our test cases; eg1; , eg2: ,eg3: .
// Explain the solution in terms of pseudocode
// Give actual solution code
//Testing of our test cases
