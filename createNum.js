// We are to input an array of numbers and create it into a string phone number format style 
// We expect parameters  in the form of an array of 10 digits, no text no string
// we are returning a phone number split into its country code and the remaining numbers split into 3 and 4 part bits
//  An example test case would be 0111799390 -> '(011) 179-9390'
