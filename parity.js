// We describe the problem we are to solve; we are to find the parity outlier that is either odd in an array of even numbers or even amongst an array of odd numbers
// We then define the parameters we would like to assign our variable input; we define a parameter that takes in an input of an array of numbers
// We give our expected return value
// We give our examples to be used as test cases eg1; eg2; eg3;
// We describe our solution in pseudocode; giving non technical procedure of solving
// We give our actual solution code
// We give our test cases
